An async comprehension is an asynchronous version of a classical comprehension.

Asyncio supports two types of asynchronous comprehensions, they are the “async for” comprehension and the “await” comprehension.

An asynchronous comprehension allows a list, set, or dict to be created using the “async for” expression with an asynchronous iterable.
